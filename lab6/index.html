					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>This was tricky because Java is still so new to me. Overall I am happy with it but it wouldn't have worked without the help of
						peer programming and asking the discord for help.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>The most major problem was the incorrect code in the images in the assignment page. After several hours of trouble 
						shooting we fixed all the things that innitially didn't work
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I think I am shakier than I previously thought with Java. After this, I feel like I feel confident about the idea
						but not confident about a errorless exicution.
