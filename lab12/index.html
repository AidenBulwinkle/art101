					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Working with your partner, create a function that depends on conditionals.</p>

					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>This lab was tricky, and I struggled to implement adding in the house with the javascript method shown in the assignment. Instead, searching through stackoverflow with my partner, we found an alternative way to print these and then it worked </p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>Overall this lab felt a bit tricky but I'm glad it walked us through it as much as this assignment did. If I had to implement the "var length = str.length;
						var mod = length % 4;" I would struggle but since that part is explained and how to do that sort of funtion works, this felt super helpful and I feel like I could repeat this for any number of possible outputs. The math is really simple but without this assignment, I would not have been able to think of this solution.</p>
