			<h1>Lab 10</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The hardest part was getting everything to run, it was a very hit or miss and small mistakes or missing parts added a lot of unnessicary stress.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>It was hard getting it to work with the past assignment 7 part, I could create a box but implementing the randomizer/alphabetizer would sometimes break it. After help from peers, we were able to get it working</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>Overall, this was more fun that I expected. The problems that arose ended up creating interesting problem solving, even though most of these failed, it was good to try stuff even if it didn't end up in the final assignment.</p>
