			<h1>Lab 3 - File Structure</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
						<p>The idea of this lab was to create a file structure
							that functions so that my website is more navigateable.
							However this proved to be somewhat difficult, I forgot a lot of
							punctuation but with peer programming we were able to spot these.
						</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>The most major problem was coding itself, a lot of small mistakes
						which ate a lot of time. Most of the problems were solved by
						trouble shooting with the partner.
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>Overall, I feel like this assignment wel really well.
						Challenges are expected and we were able to find solutions
						as problems emerged.
