			<h1>Lab 4 - Pseudocode a simple game</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Overall this went relatively smoothly. The hardest part was finding a balance between too descriptive and too simple for pseudocode.
						I feel like we hit a balance where we would not confuse ourselves if we had to code this, but it was clear enough that steps would not be lost.
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>The biggest problem is still relatively basic coding tasks. A lot of CSS in the .hmtl or vise versa but nothing that two people troubleshooting wasn't able to quickly solve
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<div class="pseudocode">
						<pre><code>
						// index.js - Aiden Olivier makes pseudocode for a simple computer game in Java
		// Author: Aiden Olivier and Elenes Vilchis
		// Date:4.24.23
		
		// Functions
		
		//Choose a random 4 letter word
			//select word from a linked file with a list of 4 letter words
		//Print 4 spaces for the words, without showing the word
		//Print first image of gallows
		//User inputs a letter 
			// If guessed correctly, correct letter is shown 
			//  If guessed incorrectly, add 1 out of 6 limbs
				//When a limb is added, move to the next image (6 images total)
			// If letter has already been guessed, allow user to put in a different input
				//Add incorrect letter to bottom of screen in alphabetical order
		//Evaluate win or lose after every letterâ€™s conditions, if neither is met repeat user input phase
		//Win condition: fills all 4 letter slots correctly
			//Show Win screen
		//Loose condition: guesses 6 letters wrong and all limbs have been imputed
			//Show loose screen of a full body being hung
