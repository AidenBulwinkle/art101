					<h2>About Aiden</h2>
					<p>Yoooo, I'm a 3rd year UCSC film major. Mainly I do 3D modeling and animition, but also have an extensive background in vfx
						and visual design/concept art. Recently, I have been photoscanning a lot of objects and creating an large amount of usable low-mid poly
						assets with the details baked as texture maps. I am hyped for the day I can mesh NeRFs.

						I am incredibly new to coding but I really like problem solving. SO far it seems really fun and like something that I might continue
						after finishing this class.
